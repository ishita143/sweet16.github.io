Dear Sister,
<br>
<p><t>I know that i am not even the last person in your piority list, but I don't care...!!  You donkey turned 16...!! You are really special, my little sisto ... :) we used to fight and hate each other the most (not 'used to' but 'still do') We make fun of all those guys and take a lot of selfies when we were alone Our long chats though we live in the same house; each and every minute we spent together; fighting, scolding, slapping is very special... I assure you that I wont let you face anything as you have faced them all. 
<br>
You are the part of my small little world. You do motivate me, always you do misunderstand me but as you know I have a big heart so it's okay... 
<br>
Okay ! okay ! Today is your day, so have a great and successful life ahead. Earn a lot of money and let me spend it  As we deramt of we will make mom-dad feel proud  I hate you ! keep smiling so that your ugly face looks a little prettier.. Have a great day with your loved ones...
<br>
Happy sweet 16 once again !!!
